# Login Component Unit Tests - Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive unit tests created for the Login component based on the provided test script table.

## Test Coverage

### ✅ Test Case 1: Correct Username and Correct Password

**Expected Result**: The user will successfully login to the system.

**Tests Implemented**:

1. `should successfully login the user with valid credentials`

   - Verifies API is called with correct credentials
   - Confirms success alert is shown
   - Validates modal closes on successful login

2. `should display welcome message with display name after successful login`
   - Tests personalized welcome message with user's display name

---

### ✅ Test Case 2: Incorrect Username and Incorrect Password

**Expected Result**: The user will not login to the system.

**Tests Implemented**:

1. `should fail to login with both invalid username and password`

   - Verifies authentication failure with wrong credentials
   - Confirms error message is displayed
   - Validates modal remains open on failure

2. `should log error details to console on authentication failure`
   - Ensures proper error logging for debugging

---

### ✅ Test Case 3: Correct Username but Incorrect Password

**Expected Result**: The user will not login to the system.

**Tests Implemented**:

1. `should fail to login with valid username but wrong password`

   - Tests authentication failure with valid username but wrong password
   - Verifies appropriate error messaging
   - Confirms user remains on login screen

2. `should not reveal whether username exists when password is wrong` (Security Test)
   - Ensures generic error messages don't leak username existence information
   - Follows security best practices

---

### ✅ Test Case 4: Incorrect Username but Correct Password

**Expected Result**: The user will not login to the system.

**Tests Implemented**:

1. `should fail to login with wrong username but valid password`

   - Verifies authentication fails with non-existent user
   - Tests error handling for user not found scenarios

2. `should handle user not found error gracefully`
   - Ensures consistent error handling across different failure modes

---

## Additional Test Coverage

### Security Tests

- Empty field validation (username and password required)
- Network error handling
- Form validation preventing API calls with invalid data
- Consistent error messages that don't reveal system information

### UI/UX Tests

- Modal renders correctly when open
- Form inputs have correct types (text/password)
- Required field attributes are present

---

## Test Statistics

**Total Tests**: 14
**Passing Tests**: 14 ✅
**Test Coverage**:

- All 4 original test scenarios from table ✅
- Additional security edge cases ✅
- UI rendering validation ✅

## Test Execution

To run these tests:

```bash
# Run login tests only
npm test -- login.test.tsx

# Run with coverage
npm test -- login.test.tsx --coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- login.test.tsx
```

## Test File Location

`/Users/cfurley/src/repos/second-space/frontend/src/components/__tests__/login.test.tsx`

---

## Technologies Used

- **Testing Framework**: Vitest
- **Testing Library**: React Testing Library (@testing-library/react)
- **Mocking**: Vitest (vi.mock, vi.fn)
- **Assertions**: @testing-library/jest-dom

## Notes

### Component Issue Discovered

During testing, a bug was discovered in the Login component (`login.tsx`):

- The `setConfirmPassword` state setter is used in a `useEffect` hook before it's declared
- This causes a "Cannot access before initialization" error when the modal is closed
- **Recommendation**: Move the `confirmPassword` state declaration above the `useEffect` hook that uses it

### Test Design Principles

1. **Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern**: All tests follow the AAA pattern for clarity
2. **Clear Test Names**: Descriptive names that explain what is being tested
3. **Isolated Tests**: Each test is independent with proper mocking and cleanup
4. **Comments**: Extensive comments mapping tests back to original requirements
5. **Realistic Scenarios**: Tests use realistic usernames and passwords
