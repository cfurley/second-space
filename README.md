## 🧪 Testing

### Prerequisites

Before running tests, ensure you have **Node.js and npm** installed:

- **Node.js** (includes npm) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- Verify installation: `node --version` and `npm --version`

Then install dependencies:

```bash
# Frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all frontend tests
cd frontend
npm test

# Run all backend tests
cd backend
npm test

# Run a specific test file
npm test login.test.tsx
```

### Where Tests Live

Tests are in `__tests__` folders:

- `frontend/src/components/__tests__/`
- `frontend/src/utils/__tests__/`
- `backend/src/controllers/__tests__/`
- `backend/src/services/__tests__/`
- `backend/src/models/__tests__/`

---

## Team Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for frontend code
- Use ESM imports (`import/export`) in backend
- Follow existing code patterns
- Add comments for complex logic

### Git Workflow

- Never commit directly to `main`
- Always work in feature branches
- Keep commits small and focused
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Wait for PR approval before merging

### Before Submitting PR

- Test locally with `docker-compose up`
- Run tests: `npm test` in frontend and backend
- Check for console errors
- Update documentation if needed
