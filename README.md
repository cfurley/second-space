# Software Engineering Group D
This is the repository for our group project in Software Engineering.
<br><br>
Once we have a project idea, we can explain the project here..
<br><br>

## Working with the Repository
When you clone into the repo on your own machine. use "git checkout dev" to 
work within the "dev" branch of the project.
<br><br>
When you push your code to the dev branch, you can open a pull request in github to
merge with the "master" aka main branch for the project.
<br><br>
The goal here is that we can all clone from master, work on dev, and upload back without
having code changing if someone uploads their code changes right before you or vice versa.
<br><br>
For better managment, and depending how comfortable everyone is with git and branches and such,
we can checkout branches for individual features, merge those to dev, then merge updates to master.
<br><br>
Anyhow if anyone reads this thanks, just trying to "git" a clean repository going for us all so
we can focus on the important part, developing the software.
